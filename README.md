##  Project Overview
This project was a "Buildout" challenge where I implemented the entire application from scratch. I focused on semantic structure, modern CSS layouts, and a mobile-first responsive strategy—all without using external UI frameworks like Bootstrap.

## ✨ Key Features & Implementation

### 1. Advanced Layouts with CSS Grid & Flexbox
* **CSS Grids**: Engineered a structured, aesthetically consistent arrangement for the 'Discover' section to handle varying image sizes.
* **CSS Flexbox**: Optimized the navigation bar and footer for perfect alignment and interactive feedback.

### 2. Interactive Discovery Section
* **Dynamic Components**: Designed custom **Image Pills** and cards with smooth hover transitions to increase user retention.

### 3. Mobile-First Responsive Design
* **Media Queries**: Implemented a "Mobile-First" strategy to ensure accessibility on devices ranging from small smartphones to large desktops.
* **Responsive Navigation**: Built a custom navigation system that adapts fluidly to mobile screen constraints.
